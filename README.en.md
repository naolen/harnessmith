If you move between several projects and coding agents, the same problems repeat: instructions drift across hosts, project
relationships and progress must be explained again, and growing history cannot all fit safely into model context.

Harnessmith is a local-first, cross-host Personal Harness distribution and work-state control plane. It safely installs one
set of personal instructions, progressive document retrieval, non-authoritative Memory, and Task tools across coding-agent
hosts, with explicit upgrade, recovery, and verification boundaries.

```bash
npx harnessmith
```

## Who it is for

- Developers who use multiple coding agents and want consistent personal instructions.
- Maintainers who need safe upgrades, backups, restore, and uninstall for a personal Harness.
- People who want resumable long-running work without treating memory as project truth.

Harnessmith is not a universal Agent Runtime and does not own model loops, tool permissions, or remote services.

## Start in 30 seconds

Node.js 24.12.0 or newer is required. No global installation is needed.

```bash
# Choose a host interactively
npx harnessmith

# Select a host; add --dry-run to inspect writes first
npx harnessmith install --agent codex
npx harnessmith --dry-run --agent codex
```

You can also ask a coding agent to read the installation protocol first:

> Read [llms.txt from the npm latest release](https://unpkg.com/harnessmith@latest/llms.txt), install Harnessmith according to that protocol, run dry-run first, and ask me before writing.

## Supported hosts

| Agent | Scope | Selector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | global | `codex` |
| Cursor | project | `cursor` |
| Claude Code | global | `claude` (alias: `claude-code`) |
| OpenCode | global | `opencode` |
| Kimi Code CLI | global | `kimi` (alias: `kimi-code`) |
| DeepSeek Harness | global | `deepseek` (aliases: `dsh`, `deepseek-harness`) |

DeepSeek Adapter installs **only** the user-global `$DSH_HOME/AGENTS.md` (default `~/.dsh/AGENTS.md`).
Project-root / nested instructions and permissions, sandbox, and approval remain host-owned; a
successful install does not mean the full DSH scope chain or formal Host Eval is verified. Compatibility
is currently claimed only for `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2` / tag `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2`; other revisions
require re-validation.

Cursor requires `--project /path/to/project`. See the
[host guide](https://alexpang.cn/harnessmith/guide/hosts) for destinations, aliases, and support evidence.

## Common operations

```bash
# Inspect ownership and file integrity
npx harnessmith status --agent codex

# Restore the previous installation layer
npx harnessmith restore --agent codex

# Restore the pre-install state and remove records
npx harnessmith uninstall --agent codex

# Inspect machine-readable Adapter boundaries
npx harnessmith capabilities --json

# Generate paste-ready Cursor User Rules text (does not write Cursor app state)
npx harnessmith export cursor-user-rules

# Check cross-repository relationships in your personal Repository Map
node <harness-path>/bin/harness.mjs repository-map check --json

# Check the embedded Runtime after installation
node <harness-path>/bin/harness.mjs health --json
```

See the [CLI reference](https://alexpang.cn/harnessmith/reference/cli) and
[safe lifecycle guide](https://alexpang.cn/harnessmith/guide/lifecycle) for all options and failure handling. The
[Runtime CLI reference](https://alexpang.cn/harnessmith/reference/runtime-cli#repository-map-维护跨项目关系) explains the
Repository Map model, evidence threshold, and maintenance commands.

## Embedded document search

`search` / `memory search` use `--mode auto` by default: a valid local full-text index enables weighted BM25 retrieval,
otherwise the commands safely fall back to the existing bounded scan. Only explicit `--refresh-index` atomically builds or
incrementally updates the rebuildable cache under `state/search/`; the cache is not a source of truth. `--mode fulltext`
fails closed when the index is unavailable, while `--mode scan` forces scanning.

## Safety boundaries

| State | Harnessmith's contract |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | Adapter distribution, preflight, backups, locks, rollback, non-authoritative Memory, Task gates, and a privacy-safe `audit record` |
| Delegated to the Host | Model loops, tool/MCP scheduling, sandboxing, approvals, tokens, and cost |
| Unsupported | A universal Runtime, Policy Engine, Pack/Registry, multi-agent orchestration, and automatic rule promotion |

Markdown instructions are guidance, not permission enforcement. The audit schema rejects raw prompt content, model output,
and tool arguments; event authenticity still belongs to the host or external attestation. See
[docs/capability-evidence.yaml](./docs/capability-evidence.yaml) for per-capability owners, states, and evidence.
